# Resume
Having recently graduated from Calcutta Institute of Engineering 
and Management with a BTech in Information Technology, I bring a 
comprehensive understanding of OOPs concepts, DSA and JDBC. 
What sets me apart is my proficiency as a full-stack Java developer, 
encompassing front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript and React library, as well as back-end technologies like 
Java, Spring Boot, and database management. My proficiency in 
DSA further strengthens my ability to design efficient algorithms, 
enhancing the robustness and scalability of applications.
